# about

Hey, I'm a highschool student and developer living in San Francisco. In addition to frontend web development, I'm interested in a wide range of topics including 3d printing, electrical engineering, and generative art.Outside of work and academics, I'm a violinist, competitive swimmer, and sport climber.

Currently, I'm building Karasu LMS and other education focused products at [Coursify Studios](https://github.com/CoursifyStudios)
