# about

Hey, I'm a highschool student and developer living in San Francisco. In addition to frontend web development, I'm interested in a wide range of topics including 3d printing, electrical engineering, and generative art. I'm also an advocate for public transportation and open source software. Outside of work and academics, I'm a violinist, competitive swimmer, and sport climber.

I'm currently building the Coursify LMS and other education-focused products at [Coursify Studios](https://github.com/CoursifyStudios), and serving as a UI/UX designer at [Trike Training](https://github.com/TrikeTraining) focused on redesigning workplace training for the modern employee.
